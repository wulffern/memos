# Why

Diodes are a magical [^1] semiconductor device that  conduct
current in one direction. It's one of the fundamental electronics components,
and it's a good idea to understand how they work.

If you don't understand diodes, then you won't understand transistors, neither
bipolar, or field effect transistors.

A useful feature of the diode is the expoential relationship
betwen the forward current, and the voltage across the device.

To understand why a diode works it's necessary to understand the physics behind
semiconductors. 

This paper attempts to explain in the simplest possible terms how a diode works [^2]


# Intrinsic carrier concentration

<!--
Integrated circuits use single crystaline silicon. The silicon crystal unit cell
is a diamond faced cubic with 8 atoms in the corners spaced at 0.543 nm, 6 at the center of the
faces, and 4 atoms inside the unit cell at a nearest neighbor distance of 0.235
nm. 
-->


The intrinsic carrier concentration of silicon, or how many free electrons and
holes at a given temperature, is given by 

$$ n_i = \sqrt{N_c N_v} e^{-\frac{E_g}{2 k T}} $$

where $E_g$ is the bandgap energy (approx 1.12 eV), $k$ is Boltsmanns constant, T is
the temperature in Kelvin, $N_c$ is the density of states in conduction band,
and $N_v$ is the density of states in the valence band. 

The density of states are

$$ N_c = 2 \left[\frac{2 \pi  k T m_n^*}{h^2}\right]^{3/2} \text{  } N_v = 2 \left[\frac{2 \pi  k T m_p^*}{h^2}\right]^{3/2} $$

where $h$ is Planck's constant, $m_n^*$ is the effective mass of holes, and
$m_p^*$ is the effective mass of holes. The effective mass of electrons and holes in silicon depend on direction of
movement, strain of silicon,  and I'm not entierly sure what is the correct number to use when
computing density of states. 

In [@cjm11] they claim the intrinsic carrier consentration is a constant, although
they do mention $n_i$ doubles every 11 degrees. In BSIM 4.8 [@bsim] $n_i$ is

$$ n_{i} = 1.45e10 \frac{TNOM}{300.15} \sqrt{\frac{T}{300.15} \exp^{21.5565981
- \frac{E_g}{2kT}}} $$


Comparing the three models in Fig. \ref{fig:ni}, we see the shape of BSIM and
the full equation is almost
the same, while the "doubling every 11 degrees" is just wrong.

![Intrinsic carrier concentration versus temperature\label{fig:ni}](ni.pdf)


At room temperature this intrinsic carrier consentration is about
$n_{i} =  1 \times 10^{16} carriers/m^3$.

That may sound like a big number, however, if we calculate the electrons
per $um^{3}$ it's
$n_{i} = \frac{1 \times 10^{16}}{(1 \times 10^{6})^{3}} carriers/\mu m^{3}< 1$,
so there are really not that many free carriers in intrinsic silicon.

# Doping

We can change the property of silicon by introducing other elements.
Phosphor has one more electron than silicon, Boron has one less
electron. Injecting these elements into the silicon crystal
lattice changes the number of free electron/holes.

These days, we usually dope with a high energy ion gun, while in the olden days,
most doping was done by diffusion. You'd paint something containing Boron on the
silicon, and then heat it in a furnance to "diffuse" the Boron atoms into the
silicon.


If we have an
element with more electrons we call it a donor, and the donor
concentration $N_{D}$. Since the crystal now has an abundance of
electrons, which have negative charge, we call it n-type.

If the element has less electrons we call
it an acceptor, and the acceptor concentration $N_{A}$. Since the
crystal now has an abundance of holes, we call it p-type. 

The doped material does not have a net charge, however, it's the same number of
electrons and protons, so even though we dope silicon, it does remain neutral.

The 
doping concentrations are larger than the intrinsic carrier
concentration, from maybe $10^{21}$ to $10^{27}$ carriers/m$^{3}$. To
separate between these concentrations we use $p-,p,p+$ or $n-, n, n+$.

The number of electrons and holes in a n-type material is

$$ n_n = N_D \text{ ,  } p_n = \frac{n_i^2}{N_D} $$

and in a p-type material

$$ p_p = N_A \text{ , } n_p = \frac{n_i^2}{N_A} $$


In a p-type crystal there is a majority of holes, and a minority of
electrons. Thus we name holes majority carriers, and electrons minority
carriers. For n-type it's opposite.

# PN junctions

Imagine an n-type material, and a p-type material, both are neutral in
charge, because they have the same number of electrons and protons. Within both
materials there are free electrons, and free holes which move around
constantly. 

Now imagine we bring the two materials together, and we call where they meet the
junction. Some of the electrons
in the n-type will wander across the junction to the p-type material, and visa versa.
On the opposite side of the junction they might find an opposite charge, and might get locked in place.
They will become stuck. 

After a while, the diffusion of charges across the junction creates a depletion region with immobile
charges. Where as the two materials used to be neutrally charged, there
will now be a build up of negative charge on the p-side, and positive
charge on the n-side. 

The charge difference will create a field, and a built-in voltage will develop across the depletion
region. 

The magnitude of the built-in voltage can be computed from Fermi-Dirac
distribution, stating that the average number of fermions in a single-particle
state $j$ is given by 

$$ n_j = \frac{1}{e^{(E_j - \mu)/kT}  + 1} $$

where $E_j$ is the energy of the single-particle state, $\mu$ is the chemical
potential. 

Assuming the exponential is much larger than 1, and taking the ratio
number of free electrons on the n-side, and p-side, we get 

$$ \frac{n_n}{n_p} = \frac{e^{(E_{n_p} - \mu)/kT}}{e^{(E_{n_n} - \mu)/kT}} =
e^{\frac{E_{n_p} - E_{n_n}}{kT}}$$

where $E_{n_p}-E_{n_n}$ is the energy difference between electrons on the p-side
and n-side. This energy difference is equivalent to $q\Phi_0$ where $\Phi_0$ is
the built-in voltage. As a result, and inserting for $n_p$, we get

$$\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2} = e^{\frac{q\Phi_0}{kT}}$$

or

$$\Phi_0 = \frac{kT}{q} ln\left(  \frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2} \right)$$

# Current

As mentioned before, we continuously have electron/hole pairs generated
by the temperature. In addition, we can have electron/hole pairs
generated by for example photons (photo diodes), or impact ionization
(charges at high speed, like radiation). Those electron/hole pairs that come
into existence in the depletion region, or happen to wander into the
depletion region before recombining will be swept across the depletion
region due to the electric field. The electron will drift to the n-type,
and holes will drift to the p-type. This drift creates a leakage current
in the diode.

To estimate the leakage current we would need to know how many
electron/hole pairs are generated per second, and how many reach the
depletion region before recombining. Not at all a trivial calculation.


If we apply a voltage in the forward direction, opposite to the field, the
current will be

$$ I_D = I_S(e^{\frac{V_D}{V_T}} - 1 ) $$

where $V_D$ is the voltage across the diode, $V_T = \frac{ kT }{q}$ and 

$$ I_S = q A n_i^2 \left (\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \frac{D_p}{L_p N_D}\right) $$

where $A$ is the area of the diode, $D_n$,$D_p$ is the diffusion constant of electrons
and holes and $L_n$,$L_p$ is the diffusion length of electrons and holes. 

# Forward voltage temperature dependence

We can rearrange $I_D$ equation to get

$$ V_D = V_T \ln\left(\frac{I_D}{I_S}\right) $$

and at first glance, it appears like $V_D$ has a positive temperature
coefficient. That is, however, wrong.

First rewrite

$$ V_D = V_T \ln{I_D} - V_T \ln{I_S} $$

$$ \ln{I_S} =  2 \ln{n_i} +  \ln{q A} + \ln{\left (\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} +
\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D}\right)} $$

Assume that diffusion constants, and diffusion lengths are independent of
temperature. That leaves $n_i$ that varies with temperature.

$$ n_i = 2 \left(\frac{ 4 \pi^2 k^2 T^2 m_n^* m_p^*}{h^4}\right)^{3/4}  e^\frac{-E_g}{2 kT} $$

$$ \ln{n_i} = \ln{2} + \frac{3}{4}\ln{\frac{4 \pi^2k^2 m_n^* m_p^*}{h^4}} + \frac{3}{2} \ln T -
\frac{E_g}{2 kT}$$

with $E_G = q V_G$ and inserting back into equation for $V_D$

$$ V_D = \frac{kT}{q}(\ell  - 3 \ln T) + V_G $$ 


Where $\ell$ is temperature independent, and given by

$$ \ell= \ln{\frac{I_D}{2Aq}} - \ln{\left (\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} +
\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D}\right)} - \frac{3}{4}\ln{\frac{4 \pi^2k^2m_n^* m_p^*}{h^4}} $$


From  equations above we can see that at 0 K, we expect the diode voltage to be
equal to the bandgap of silicon. Diodes don't work at 0K though. 

Although it's not trivial to see that the diode
voltage has a negative temperature coefficient, if you do compute it as in
[vd.py](https://github.com/wulffern/memos/blob/main/2021-07-08_diodes/vd.py), then you'll see it decreases. 

The slope of the diode voltage can be seen to depend on the area, the current,
doping, diffusion contstant, diffusion length and the effctive masses. 

Fig. \ref{fig:vd} shows the $V_D$ and the deviation of $V_D$ from a straight line. The
non-linear component of $V_D$ is only a few mV. If we could combine $V_D$ with a
voltage that increased with temperature, then we could get a stable voltage
across temperature to within a few mV.

# Bandgap references

Assume we have a circuit like Fig. \ref{fig:ptat} 
Here we have two diodes, biased at different current densities. The voltage on
the left diode $V_{D1}$ is equal to the sum of the voltage on the right diode $V_{D2}$ and voltage
accross the resistor $R_1$. The current in the two diodes are the same due to
the current mirror. A such, we have that

$$ I_S e^\frac{qV_{D1}}{kT} = N I_S e^\frac{qV_{D2}}{kT} $$

Taking logartihm of both sides, and rearranging, we see that 

$$ V_{D1} - V_{D2} = \frac{kT}{q}\ln{N}$$

Or that the difference between two diode voltages biased at different current densities is proportional to absolute
temperature. 

In the circuit above, this $\Delta V_D$ is across the resistor
$R_1$, as such, the $I_D  = \Delta V_D/R_1$. We have a current that is
proportional to temperature.

If we copied the current, and sent it into a series combination of a resistor
$R_2$ and a diode, we could scale the $R_2$ value to give us the exactly right
slope to compensate for the negative slope of the $V_D$ voltage. 

The voltage across the resistor and diode would be constant over temperature,
with the small exception of the non-linear component of $V_D$.
